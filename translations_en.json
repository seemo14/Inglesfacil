Try to understand the main idea first, then focus on details.\n*   **Read Regularly:** Start with simple articles or children's books and gradually move to more complex materials. Don't worry about understanding every word.\n*   **Keep a Journal:** Write a few sentences in English each day about your activities, thoughts, or feelings. Don't stress about perfection.\n*   **Review Consistently:** Regularly revisit what you've learned to move it from short-term to long-term memory.\n*   **Stay Motivated:** Find ways to make learning fun! Watch English YouTubers, join online communities, or reward yourself for reaching milestones."
